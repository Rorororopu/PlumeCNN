# To-do List

## Tasks

1. Interpolation
2. Calculate Gradient
3. Visualization (scatterplot)
4. Streamline

## Problems

1. Interpolation
For 3D data, doing direct interpolation will use soo many memory that can't be completed by HPC.
So what we do is to first interpolate z-slice, then interpolate y slice.
